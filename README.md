# UFO Boost Game
This is my first attempt at making a game in Unity using C#. The game allows the
player to control a UFO through 6 different levels of mazes that get increasingly
more difficult. If the UFO touches anything but the beginning platform, the
UFO will explode. If the player reaches the ending platform without dying, the player
will proceed to the next level.
